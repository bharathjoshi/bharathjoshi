The city with most population (Shanghai ) has a population of 26.3 million compare to world population of 7.53 billion which is just 0.34% So now let us assume all the people are living in the same city(the earth being a city) i.e we’ll all be governed by the same government, will have same price for all goods and many more things that I’ll be discussing . The foremost problem all the people will be facing is to choose what type of political system the city needs i.e. democracy, oligarchy or autocracy. Mostly the decision would be taken by the representatives of the earlier present countries. So the first face-off occurs . Representatives from democratic countries would want a democratic system , other countries would want dictatorship , others would ask for a constitutional monarchy under some royal family, some others would want some other type of system . So let us thing the majority wins, so the form of governance would be a democratic system. So now desire and lust for power comes into everyone’s mind. Leaders from different parties will start targeting people based on their nationality (people in the name of patriotism will start supporting the party which existed in their countries) religion and language . Parties with similar ideology towards religion and language would form alliances. People would start forming groups, differences would be created . People from one group will start targeting people of other groups . Many riots will take place . The whole point of living together goes waste. So let us now assume some party is elected (setting up elections would be liking boiling the ocean). The elected party will have a big task to satisfy all the people . The first thing government should do is to set the price of goods in the market .As all the people are governed by same government , the prices of all goods and services should be same to all the people (large differences would be a failure of government). So the people living in latitude 19.0154° S, 29.1 (earlier Zimbabwe) will have to pay the same price for a litre of petrol as the people in latitude 6.4238° N, 66.5897° W (earlier Venezuela) . The earlier price for a litre of petrol in Zimbabwe was around $3.32 and in Venezuela was $0.029 .So let us think the government will set a price of $1.67 which will be highly celebrated by people of Zimbabwe but at the same time will be heavily opposed by people of Venezuela. Other political parties would happily take this as an opportunity for defaming the elected party. Don’t really know what will happen with the economy (Economists please help !!) . Government should provide everyone with food, education, shelter and any more things . The sector of people who already have all this facilities would expect more from the government while people who don’t have the facilities would expect the government to provide them minimum stuff . They would be no balanced development . People from developed areas would want to show more dominance which will not be liked by other people. Fair distribution of natural resources equal would be a difficult task. Again internal disturbance increase and people would start fighting for equality or power. People will start fighting for a language , religion or a sport. Different group of people will ask for their liberation and ask for a new city. Eventually everyone will ask for their own city . Cities will become countries and they would be no common city. The only positive thing that would happen would be that people now will become more patriotic and try to develop their country . </Center></Center> <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//tags/#Government" title="Pages tagged Government" class="tag"><span class="term">Government</span></a><a href="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//tags/#Economy" title="Pages tagged Economy" class="tag"><span class="term">Economy</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//code-highlighting-post/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Share</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//code-highlighting-post/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//code-highlighting-post/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bharathjoshi.github.io/bharathjoshi//assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <!-- MathJax --> <script async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script> </body> </html>
